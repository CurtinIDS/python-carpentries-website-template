<h2 id="general">General Information</h2>

<p>
<strong><a href="https://carpentries.org">The Carpentries</a></strong> project comprises the <a
href="{{site.swc_site}}">Software Carpentry</a>, <a href="{{site.dc_site}}">Data Carpentry</a>, and
<a href="{{site.lc_site}}">Library Carpentry</a> communities of Instructors, Trainers, Maintainers,
helpers, and supporters who share a mission to teach foundational computational and data science
skills to researchers. This workshop is a 2-day blend of both Software Carpentries and Data caprnetires.



<p>
  <a href="{{site.swc_site}}">Software Carpentry</a>
  aims to help researchers get their work done
  in less time and with less pain
  by teaching them basic research computing skills.
  This hands-on workshop will cover basic concepts and tools,
  including program design, version control, data management,
  and task automation.
  Participants will be encouraged to help one another
  and to apply what they have learned to their own research problems.
</p>



<p>
  <a href="{{site.dc_site}}">Data Carpentry</a> develops and teaches workshops on the fundamental data skills needed to conduct
  research. Its target audience is researchers who have little to no prior computational experience,
  and its lessons are domain specific, building on learners' existing knowledge to enable them to quickly
  apply skills learned to their own research.
  Participants will be encouraged to help one another
  and to apply what they have learned to their own research problems.
